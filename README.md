# PeopleCode Syntax Highlighting for Notepad++

This repository contains an [XML file](PeopleCodeUDL.xml) that adds PeopleCode Syntax highlighting to Notepad++.

## Setting up PeopleCode Syntax Highlighting
To use this syntax highlighting, open Notepad++ and click on the "Language" tab in the menu. At the bottom, click "Define your language..." It will bring up a dialogue. In this dialogue there is an option "Import..." near the top left. Click it and locate the PeopleCodeUDL.xml file. This will import the language.

Now that the xml file has been set up, if you want to turn on PeopleCode highlighting for any document, go the the "Language" tab again and select "PeopleCode" at the bottom, below "Define your language..." and the document will have the syntax applied to it.

## Modifications
If you want to modify the highlighting styles, you might want to familiarize yourself with User Define Language (UDL) settings, which can be found on the "Define your language..." dialogue.

## Disclaimer
The sytnax UDL file was based off of [the work](http://www.workingscripts.com/2009/06/notepad-peoplecode-sqr/) of [Iouri "Yury" Chadour](http://www.workingscripts.com/about/). This makes some modifications and improvements to the syntax highlighting found there.
